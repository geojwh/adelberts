## adelberts

This is a repo for beta testing new web maps for Adelbert's brewery. Currently (as of December 2016), I am working on shifting the map to Leaflet (no Mapbox), as well as changing the data from physical marker locations where consumers can buy the beer, to distributor counties where consumers can purchase Adelbert's beer. This change is due to the lack of a dynamic location data source, which would come from actual logistics/distributor information.
